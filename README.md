# TechMarketPredictiveModeller

Developed a predictive model to estimate laptop prices using advanced data science techniques. Imported and preprocessed a dataset, handled missing data, standardized attributes, and visualized data patterns. Conducted descriptive statistical analysis and used regression models (linear, multiple, and polynomial) to predict prices. Improved model performance through cross-validation, Ridge Regression, and Grid Search for hyperparameter optimization.
